# Disclaimer and Setup

Just my Setup for hyprland, hyprpaper, waybar, wlogout, rofi, ghostty and wallpapers. If found, you can use it if you want to, its personalised for me, but you might like it, so give it a shot if you want.

Uses some files from: 

-ml4w (https://www.ml4w.com/)
-Keyitdev (https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme/tree/master)
-newmanls (https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection?tab=readme-ov-file)

Left their file header in the files intact, but also modified most files to suit my taste better.

But be aware:

-The script is written with the use of Chatgpt.

-Im a beginner in this sort of stuff so its not optimised or anything.

-Tested only in a VM so the install on bare metal might brake.


If you find any obvious problems be sure to reach out!

Automatic install:
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Syntr1x/hyprconf.syn/master/install.sh)"
```
