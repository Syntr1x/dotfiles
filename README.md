# Disclaimer and Setup

Just my Setup for hyprland, hyprpaper, waybar, wlogout, rofi, ghostty and wallpapers (with a simple themeselector script). 

Uses some files from: 

- ml4w (https://www.ml4w.com/)
  > &#8593; the beginning of my rice was a modified version of one of his old setups.

- Keyitdev (https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme/tree/master)
  > &#8593; his install script is straight up used in the install.sh script of mine.

- newmanls (https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection?tab=readme-ov-file)
  > &#8593; changed colors of rounded themes to match the wallpapers.

But be aware:

- The script is written with the assistance of Ai.

- Im a beginner in this sort of stuff so its not optimised or anything.

- Tested in a VM so the install on bare metal might cause problems.

If you find any obvious problems be sure to reach out!

Automatic install:
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Syntr1x/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```
