# Archconfig
Just my configs for hyprland, hyprpaper, waybar, rofi and wallpapers. If found, you can use it if you want to, its personalised for me, but you might like it, so give it a shot if you want.

(some files from ML4W and the sddm theme script is Keyitdev's (https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme/tree/master)

But be aware:

-THE SCRIPT IS WRITTEN WITH CHATGPT SO BE CAREFULL 

-IM A BEGINNER WITH ARCH AND GITHUB

Automatic install:
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Syntr1x/hyprconf.syn/master/install.sh)"
```
